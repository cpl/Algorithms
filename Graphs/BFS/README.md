Performing a Breadth First Search on a directed graph, computing distance from 
the start positions to all edges and their parents. 
Graph is represented as a Map of adjacency lists, which has a list for each node.
Input is a number representind the number of edges and a list of pairs, 
indexOfStartEdge - indexOfDestinationEdge which represent vertices.

Applications: 
	-verify if the graph is connex;
	-compute distance between a start point and any points;
